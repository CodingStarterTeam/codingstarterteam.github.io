You can use the [editor on GitHub][Readme_Editer] to maintain and preview the
content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll][] to
rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It
includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- List

2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown][Master_MD].

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have
selected in your [repository settings][Setting]. The name of this theme is
saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
